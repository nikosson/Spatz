# Spatz

**Spatz** is a simple knowledge market(ask question and get answer) resource, like [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) or [toster](https://toster.ru/).

It is built on [Laravel](http://laravel.com) framework. 

The aim of the project is to **learn Laravel framework**, so it's better not to use it in commercial needs.
